Vastu Tips For Your Office in a Commercial Building</h2>
            <h5>1. Office direction and Entrance</h5>
            <p>
              The office should be facing north, north-east or north-west. North, north-east or north-west directions indicate a good future and positivity for the business. Also, they are the most auspicious guidelines for office space and make employees feel fresh and productive. The north direction is known as the direction of Kubera (lord of wealth), thus it also gives us financial profit.</p>

<p>East is also known as the right office direction after the north direction. And if it is an office related to the service industry, the east direction is the right one to choose. There is a sunrise direction to the east and this gives a good boost to the work.</p>

<p>According to commercial architecture, the entrance door or flat of the office building should be on the north or east side. But, make sure that you do not bring any obstruction near the entrance door as it may interfere with your business. Also, the entrance door should not be opened to the inner wall as this may block the flow of energy.</p>

            </p>
            <h5>2. Reception area</h5>
            <p>The reception area makes the first impression on visitors. Whether it is a customer, an employee or a guest, the reception plays a major role in describing the nature and strength of the company or organization. Thus, the reception area should be very relaxing and giving positive vibes.</p><p>
The reception should ideally be built in an east or northeast direction. Also, the reception area should have a comfortable seating area and the receptionist should sit facing east or north. Ideally, the company profile should be placed on the south wall of the reception area. And the reception table should be diagonal to the door. Decorating flowers and giving sweets in any way creates positive and better value for the visitors.</p>

<h5>3. Staircase</h5>

<p>In the office, it is better to build a staircase in the south or south-west. But, make sure you don’t build one in the middle of the office as this can cause financial loss to the owner. And the stairs should be painted in subtle light colors and you should avoid shades of black and red.</p>

<h5>4. Pantry</h5>
<p>
For a productive day in the office, you need to be energetic enough to work all day. And it is very important in the office to keep yourself active and energetic pantry.
</p><p>
According to the architectural tips for the office, the pantry should be located in the south-east direction; It is known as the ideal direction. And make sure you never build a pantry facing north. Also, never paint the pantry red or pink, instead paint it blue and put greenery around it.
</p><p>
The most important thing when eating in the office is that you should have a separate place to eat. Never take a meal at your workstation / work desk as it is for work only and should not do other stuff there.</p>

<h5>5. Washroom</h5>
<p>
In the office, the washroom should be built on the west or north-west side. And if you are buying a new office, you should check in the direction of the washroom. Also, make sure the washroom is not facing northeast, southeast or east. Washrooms are usually associated with negative and bad energy, thus architectural tips for the office must be considered.</p>

<h5>6. Colors</h5>
<p>
The interior decoration and colors of the office should be bright and vibrant as per the architectural instructions for business. Bright colors are known to spread positivity in every corner and it reflects light in all directions. It is also said that if the walls in the office are painted darker, more negative vibrations will be attracted, hindering success.</p>

<p>
The use of colors like blue, white and gray brings bright joy. Here you have the colors listed, look!


White, cream and yellow tones: These colors can be used for southeast, east, northeast and northwest walls.
Blue: Blue should be applied on the south wall, as blue will be controlled by Saturn according to the architecture.<br>
Green: Any shade of green can be used on south-west walls and will be very beneficial for office work.<br>
Red, Pink or Coral: These colors are not suitable for office in commercial architecture, but you can paint the south wall with these colors if you like.</p>
<h5>7. Deity</h5>
<p>

People definitely worship their idols and deities like Ganesh, Sai Baba, Lakshmi ji or Lord Krishna and want to keep their pictures or anything related to them in their office to get prosperity. But according to Vastushastra, there should be a proper place to keep idols and images of deities. Here we will tell the details, look!</p><p>

According to the commercial architecture, it is advisable to place your idol or image of God in the reception area of ​​your office as a place for every office or employee to visit. And the reception desk should ideally face north-east. When placing photographs of deities and idols, make sure they go inside the office.It shows that when the owner or employee leaves the office, they will see the idols in their direction. And it will bring positivity and great enthusiasm to do more. But do not place pictures of idols or deities on your work desk or on the back of your seat, as this is not considered respectable in commercial architecture.</p>

<p>God has supreme power and authority and therefore His picture must be kept separate to work day and night. And idols and deities should be given a separate place and space.</p>

<h5>8. Seating Arrangement</h5>
<p>
The seating arrangement in the office must be planned according to Vastu tips for office:</p>
<p>
a) Owner seating arrangement<br>

For the owner, the seating arrangement should be east or north facing. The west is also considered fine, but it does not face south. Also, make sure that this temple or any idol or image of God is not placed on the back of the owner's throne as a commercial architecture. Also, there must be a solid wall behind the owner’s seat and not some wooden wall or curtain. It shows hard work and determination.</p>
<p>
b) Manager seating arrangement<br>

Seating arrangements for office managers, directors and officers should be in the same, south or west section of the office as per commercial architecture. This seating arrangement helps the manager to make better decisions at work and brings positive energy.</p>
<p>
c) Employees seating arrangement<br>

For employees, seating arrangements in the office must be to the north or east. Working north or east increases the productivity of employees. Also, ensure that employees do not sit directly under the light beam in the office, as architecture reduces productivity accordingly. And in such cases, it is impossible to avoid the light beam, then cover it with wooden planks.</p>
